We use the same level of skill in protecting your Personal Information as other similar games developers. However, since the internet is not a completely secure environment we cannot guarantee that information you transmit via our Games will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of any of our safeguards.</p>

<p>We may provide links to third party websites from our Services.

<p>You also have the right to complain to your local data protection authority if there is a problem.</p>

<p>14. Legal matters</p>

<p>If any court or other competent authority finds any of the terms of this Privacy Policy to be invalid or unenforceable, the other terms of this Privacy Policy will not be affected.</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy is governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of South Korea. Any dispute arising in connection with this Privacy Policy will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of South Korea unless you choose the courts of your home country.</p>
